> today i learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really warrant a full blog post. These are things I've picked up by Learning In Public™ and pairing with smart people at Hashrocket.


这是一本关于我每天学习的各种语言和技术的小事情的简明评论集。这些并不是真正值得一篇完整的博客文章。这些都是我在社区中或者和聪明的人合作时学到的。
